# Refractor-Challenge

## Project Description

The Horiseon homepage is the first thing a user engages with so it has to be accessible, interactive, and dynamic.

In this project I edited Horiseon's HTML and CSS to make it more accessible and added comments for clarification of what each part of code does. This looks like condensing selectors that shared the same values into one block of code in CSS, adding alt's to images and icons in HTML, making semantic elements specified, making sure all selectors and elements followed a logical order, and debugging any broken links. 
 
With this project the thing I struggled with the most was sorting through and doing the tediuous work of re-naming most elements that were originally under "div," but now I have a better understanding as to why we use semantic elements rather than general ones whenever possible.
